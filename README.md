# Keyboardless-Gaming

## Setup

A valid [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation, [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/), [Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/), and a few other miscellaneous libraries. A [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) API key will also be needed; this can also be substituted for other speech recognition endpoints, see [here](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/audio_transcribe.py) for an example.
